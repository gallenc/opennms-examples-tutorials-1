# Gpon Correlation Examples

THIS VERION IS SIMPLY ILLUSTRATING DOWNSRTEAM NODES - NO SYSLOGS

These examples use PRIS to load configuration and netsnmp or frr to simulate devices

This simple proof of concept shows how OpenNMS parent child relationships can be used to represent a gpon network with passive splices and end points.

LOOK AT THIS EXAMPLE

[minimal-minion-kafka-simple](../opennms-gpon-correlation-1/minimal-minion-kafka-simple) is a simple example using netsnmp docker containers to represent end points. 

NOT COMPLETE 

[minimal-minion-kafka](../opennms-gpon-correlation-1/minimal-minion-kafka) is work in progress using frrouter.
