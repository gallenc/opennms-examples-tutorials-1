# GPON Correlation scenario currently implemented

# scenario overview


A NOC needs to be informed immediately of problems which are SLA impacting and which they can take actions to remedy. 
However in a major event, the network can produce far too much fault information for operators to analyse manually. 
Automated assistance is required to help diagnose the underlying problem quickly and reduce the visual noise of a 'storm' of sympathetic alarms.

Alarm and event correlation is a process by which a network management system seeks to present users with useful and actionable information from all of the sources of information available to it.

1. reduce the events to a set of alarms which represent the current state of problems in the network
2. create new alarms (or situations) for scenarios where the underlying pattern of alarms point to a specific problem

Scenario:

A GPON fibre network is an access network essentially organised in a tree topology.

At the head-end an OLT (optical line termination) sends multiplexed light signals to multiple  ONT (optical Network termination) consumer units.

OLT devices typically host many OLT's and are themselves connected to an edge router which feeds into the core network. 

ONT's are situated on customer premises and are variously subject to accidental disconnection, power outages or other failures local to the customer. 

ONT alarms need to be recorded and processed by the service management team as they affect the SLA with a customer and may also be required to be reported to the regulator. 
Individual ONT alarms are typically ignored by the NOC as there can be many thousands of them at any one time and they do not necessarily indicate a network wide problem. 
However a pattern of multiple ONT alarms may point to a fibre or OLT problem further up the GPON tree.

Between the ONTs and an OLT are geographically dispersed passive optical splitters which fan out the head-end fibre to each of the ONT's. 
Cityfibre refers to head-end as a  FEX (fibre exchange) and the splitters are arranged in a two tier architecture of PRIMARY and SECONDARY nodes fanning out from the FEX. 
Typically an OLT is connected to one PRIMARY node which fans out to eight SECONDARY nodes which in turn fan out to eight ONTs. 

If a fault happens in a fibre feeding a PRIMARY or SECONDARY node, it will affect communications with all of the OLT's below that point.
This can generate a sea of alarms but the NOC needs to be able to quickly identify where a fibre cut may have happened and ignore the sympathetic alarms it may have created.

The FEX, PRIMARY and SECONDARY nodes may also internally be arranged in a hierarchy of shelves and connectors. 
It is possible that an engineer working on a node may disrupt one of these internal splitters which will cause a fault for some customers but not the entire node.

Fibre cuts will cause a major outages but degradation to the signal path may also create intermittent low signal levels or high bit error rates. 
These sorts of issues need to be detected as they may precede a major problem but should be addressed through regular maintenance and are not necessarily priority problems for the NOC.

Alarms in the access network are typically concerned only with the local GPON and usually propagate sympathetic alarms into the core.
Thus the alarm management of each FEX region can be essentially stand alone from the management of the core.

## required correlation

1. record and correctly associate alarms with affected OLT's and ONT's in such a way is it is possible for later reports to be created on service impact for individual customers

2. record but do not bring to the NOC's attention alarms on individual ONT's

3. record for later reporting alarms where an intermittent problem or degradation may be occurring but which is not currently a major outage.

4. correlate critical ONT alarms across the GPON topology to quickly detect the location of major fibre outages.

## critical alarms and alarm parsing

## solution 

The figure below illustrates the event flow and correlation within OpenNMS.

![Alt text](../docs/images/syslogprocessing.drawio.png)

### 1. inventory
A correct inventory and network model is critical to any correlation. 
OpenNMS can model tree networks using the parent node feature. 
Within OpenNMS we represent ONTs, LTE's, PRIMARY NODES, SECODNARY NODES and connected PE routers.
Each node is created with a link to it's parent node. 
We also populate the asset table for each node with the devices serial number and asset number which are used as the key within LTE events to associate alarms to the correct OLT.

The Provisioning Integration Server (PRIS) is used to create the provisioning requisitions from a CSV file provided by the customer. 
An extra translator process for pris is used to map the customer csv to the OpenNMS requisition including the parent relationships needed for the model.

This allows us to visualise the GPON hierarchy as shown below.

![Alt text](../docs/images/gponHeirarchy.png)

### 2. parsing events and syslogs

Nokia and Calix GPON devices use Syslog to report alarms. 
The format of the syslogs and content of messages from both devices differ significantly. 
The first stage of the process is to correctly parse these messages into useful OpenNMS Events.

### 3. creating new alarms for ONTs

The customer located ONT's do not generate any alarms directly but instead rely on problems being reported by their parent  OLT. 
The event translator is used to parse the ONT identifiers (Asset or Serial numbers) from OLT events and do a database look up to find which Node in OpenNMS to associate the alarm with. 
This process is performed in the event-translator.


### 4. finding related alarms

OpenNMS has the concept of a Situation which is an alarm that wraps other alarms and represents a collection of sympathetic alarms around a network event. 
The following image illustrates how situations are included in an alarm list. 

![Alt text](../docs/images/situationsA.png)

The detail of situation 1365 is illustrated below.
Note that a Situation is an alarm with associated alarms (which can also be situations).
In this case all four ONT's below lec191-olt-secondary have low-rx-opt-pwf-fe alarms.

![Alt text](../docs/images/situationsB.png)

To discover a situation, we need to use the topology model to relate alarms and discover whether all of the OLT's below a network splitter have critical alarms. 
If all of the ONT's have a critical alarm, then we know that there is probably a problem with the fibre above the splitter.

If all of the ONT's below a `SECONDARY NODE` have any one of the critical alarms described above, we create a situation.

### Situation detection using JDBC poller

We use database scanning using the JDBC service poller to run sql queries repeatedly every minute to find these situations. 
If a situation is found a service down alarm is created for the passive splitter.

The image below shows the jdbc poller service `passive-secondary-node` running for `lec191-olt-1_SECONDARY`

![Alt text](../docs/images/jdbcservice.png)

The actual service definition is in `poller-configuration.xml`

```
      <!-- for polling downstream alarms on passive secondary nodes -->
      <!-- Calix ONT critical alarms ont-eth-down,ont-dying-gasp,ont-missing,low-rx-opt-pwr-fe,loss-of-pon,lacp-fault-on-port,lag-group-down,duplex-system-failure,card-departed -->
      <!-- Nokia ONT critical alarms lan-los,onu-dying-gasp,onu-loss-of-phy-layer,transceiver-link-rx-power-->
      <service name="passive-secondary-node" interval="30000" user-defined="false" status="on">
         <parameter key="driver" value="org.postgresql.Driver" />
         <parameter key="user" value="opennms" />
         <parameter key="password" value="opennms" />
         <parameter key="url" value="jdbc:postgresql://database:5432/opennms" />
         <parameter key="query" value="WITH

           child_count_query AS (SELECT COUNT(*) AS childCount FROM node n WHERE n.nodeparentid IN (SELECT parentId FROM parent_id_query) ),
           distinct_alarm_count_query AS (SELECT COUNT(*) AS distinctAlarmCount 
              FROM ( SELECT DISTINCT al.nodeid  FROM alarms al INNER JOIN string_to_table('ont-eth-down,ont-dying-gasp,ont-missing,low-rx-opt-pwr-fe,loss-of-pon,lacp-fault-on-port,lag-group-down,duplex-system-failure,card-departed,lan-los,onu-dying-gasp,onu-loss-of-phy-layer,transceiver-link-rx-power', ',') AS t(name) ON al.reductionkey LIKE CONCAT( '%:',name) 
                     WHERE al.severity>3 
                     AND al.nodeid IN (SELECT n.nodeid FROM node n WHERE n.nodeparentid IN (SELECT parentId FROM parent_id_query)) ) AS tempTable )
           SELECT (CASE WHEN childCount=0 THEN 0 WHEN distinctAlarmCount>= childCount THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS serviceDown, childCount, distinctAlarmCount  FROM  child_count_query, distinct_alarm_count_query" />
         <parameter key="column" value="serviceDown" />
         <parameter key="action" value="compare_int" />
         <parameter key="operator" value="&lt;" />
         <parameter key="operand" value="1" />
         <parameter key="message" value="suspected fibre cut above passive node ${node:foreign-source}:${node:foreign-id}" />
      </service>
```

Various values are substituted from the node definition. 

The effective query is shown in the poller service parameters image above and is used in the description below.

The query is a bit complex but is is quite logical if we break it down.

```
WITH 
    parent_id_query AS (SELECT n.nodeid AS parentId FROM node n WHERE n.foreignsource='gpon3' AND n.foreignid='lec191-olt-1_SECONDARY' ), 

    child_count_query AS (SELECT COUNT(*) AS childCount FROM node n WHERE n.nodeparentid IN (SELECT parentId FROM parent_id_query) ),

    distinct_alarm_count_query AS (SELECT COUNT(*) AS distinctAlarmCount FROM ( 
        SELECT DISTINCT al.nodeid FROM alarms al INNER JOIN 
        string_to_table('ont-eth-down,ont-dying-gasp,ont-missing,low-rx-opt-pwr-fe,loss-of-pon,lacp-fault-on-port,lag-group-down,duplex-system-failure,card-departed,lan-los,onu-dying-gasp,onu-loss-of-phy-layer,transceiver-link-rx-power', ',') 
        AS t(name) ON al.reductionkey LIKE CONCAT( '%:',name) 

        WHERE al.severity>3 AND al.nodeid IN (SELECT n.nodeid FROM node n WHERE n.nodeparentid IN (SELECT parentId FROM parent_id_query)) 
        ) AS tempTable ) 

SELECT (CASE WHEN childCount=0 THEN 0 WHEN distinctAlarmCount>= childCount THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS serviceDown, childCount, distinctAlarmCount FROM child_count_query, distinct_alarm_count_query 
```

For a service to be down, a JDBC poller query must return a single row with a column `serviceDown = 1` if a problem is detected and `serviceDown = 0` if there is no problem.

Starting with the last `SELECT` statement, we can see that a serviceDown=1 is generated if `distinctAlarmCount` is greater or equal to the `childCount`

The `childCount` is the number of ONT nodes which have the `lec191-olt-1_SECONDARY` node as their parent node.

The `distinctAlarmCount` is the number of child nodes with one or more critical alarms.

If the `distinctAlarmCount` is equal to the number of child ONT nodes, then all the OLT's connected to the secondary node have a critical problem and so the fibre between the secondary node and the primary node is probably cut.

Three sub queries are defined in a `WITH` statement to get this result.

`parent_id_query finds` all the primary keys for all the nodes (OLTs) which have `lec191-olt-1_SECONDARY` as their parent.

`child_count_query` uses the `parent_id_query` to count the number of children which have `lec191-olt-1_SECONDARY` as their parent.

`distinct_alarm_count_query` looks for all the nodes found from the `parent_id_query` which have one or more critical alarm(s).

The alarm type is determined by the last segment of the alarm reduction key 

for instance in alarm `1364`, the reduction key is `uei.opennms.org/Translator/Calix/Axos/ONT/Alarm/Raise::867:low-rx-opt-pwr-fe`

The `distinctAlarmCount` has a constant name table which defines the names of all of the possible alarm types we care about (and which can be changed to match new alarms).

This contains `low-rx-opt-pwr-fe` and so the query will match alarm 1364

So the query is looking for alarms with severity>3 ( i.e. not cleared) and alarm type in the names table and the node is a child of the `lec191-olt-1_SECONDARY`

Thus the  `distinct_alarm_count_query` counts each node for which one or more critical alarm match is found.


# situation creation using Drools rules

We use Drools rules to create the situation from the service down alarms detected using the database query above.

The Drools rule is in `drools-rules.d/gpon-rules.drl`

The Drools rule looks for `serviceDown` alarms on each splitter and then looks for all alarms below the splitter to associate into a situation.
It does not itself detect the situation but gathers all of the alarms below a splitter node where a situation is suspected.

It may be possible to rules to actually detect the situation instead of using the database query but we tried this and it was bit unstable but may be possible with more investigation. 

The core of the gpon rule is reflected below:

```
rule "parent situation rule"

  enabled true
    
  when
    $sessionClock : SessionClock()

    // get node lost service alarm for passive splitters
    $alarm : OnmsAlarm(uei =="uei.opennms.org/nodes/nodeLostService",
                       alarmType == OnmsAlarm.PROBLEM_TYPE,
                       severity != OnmsSeverity.CLEARED, 
                       isSituation() == false,
                       getServiceType().getName() in ("passive-secondary-node", "passive-primary-node"),
                       node!=null,
                       $nodeid : node.id
                      )
                      
                      
    // get alarms below the splitter
    $relatedAlarms : LinkedList( ) 
                   from collect ( OnmsAlarm(alarmType == OnmsAlarm.PROBLEM_TYPE || alarmType == OnmsAlarm.PROBLEM_WITHOUT_RESOLUTION_TYPE, 
                       severity != OnmsSeverity.CLEARED, 
                       node != null,
                       node.parent !=null,
                       node.getParent().getId() == $nodeid                
                  ) )
                  

  then
 
    Date now = new Date(drools.getWorkingMemory().getSessionClock().getCurrentTime());
     
    // debugging messages - note change to alarmService.debug in production

    String msg = "related alarms: ";

         if(relatedAlarm.getSeverity() != OnmsSeverity.CLEARED ) {
             alarmService.warn("parent situation rule: adding reduction key from relatedAlarm {}", relatedAlarm);
             alarmReductionKeys.add(relatedAlarm.getReductionKey());

```

In OpenNMS, situations are distinguished from normal alarms through having parameters with names which which begin with `related-reductionKey-`
We need to turn the original serviceDown alarm into a situation by adding `related-reductionKey-` parameters referencing each of the reduction keys of the related alarms.

Looking at the `parent situation rule`

All of the clauses under the `when` have to resolve for the rule to fire and the java code in the `then` section run.

The first `when` clause looks for all uncleared OnmsAlarm instances for nodeLostService alarms.
It checks the service type for the two services `passive-secondary-node`, `passive-primary-node`.

Once a service alarm is found, the next clause looks for all of the active alarms which have the same parent node.
This assumes that the database search has already found a fibre problem above the splitter so all of the alarms in nodes below this splitter are probably related to this fibre cut.  

Having found the related alarms we extract their reduction keys in order to create the situation.

The function `turnAlarmIntoSituation` creates an event with the same uei as the original serviceDown alarm.
When this event is sent, it is reduced into the same alarm and the additional `related-reductionKey-` parameters are added which turns this alarm into a situation.
